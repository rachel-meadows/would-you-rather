# Would You Rather?

This is a simple game that associates users with their answers to a 'would you rather' question.

## Origins:

An earlier version of this game was developed as a Friday group project (essentially a one-day hackathon).
While we reached MVP for this as a group (showing a single question and its aggregate results), I had an idea for a database structure that I want to test. I also wanted to make the project dynamically support multiple questions, instead of hard-coding it.

## Purpose:

- Test composite key idea and see if it would have worked
- Practice setting up routes in Express
- Practice using views and partials in Handlebars
- Reflect on solving problems in individual vs. group projects for better self-knowledge and collaboration
