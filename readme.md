# Would You Rather?

This is a simple game that associates users with their answers to a 'would you rather' question.

## Origins:

The initial code for this game was developed as a Friday group project (essentially a one-day hackathon).
While we reached MVP for this as a group (showing a single question and aggregate results), I had an idea for a many-to-many database that I want to test.

## Purpose:

- Test composite key idea and see if it would have worked
- Practice setting up routes in Express
- Practice using views and partials in Handlebars
- Reflect on approach to solving problems in individual projects vs. group projects for better self-knowledge / collaboration
